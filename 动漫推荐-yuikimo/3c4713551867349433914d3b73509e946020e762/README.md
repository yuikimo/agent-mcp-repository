A smart [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for [AniList](https://anilist.co) that understands your anime and manga taste - not just raw API calls.

## What makes this different

Most AniList integrations mirror the API 1:1. ani-mcp adds an intelligence layer on top:

- **Taste profiling** - builds a model of your preferences from your completed list
- **Personalized picks** - "what should I watch next?" based on your taste, mood, and seasonal lineup
- **Compatibility** - compare taste between two users
- **Sequel alerts** - find sequels airing this season for shows you've finished
- **Watch order** - franchise chain traversal for long-running series
- **Session planning** - "I have 90 minutes, what should I watch?" from your current list
- **Year in review** - your watching/reading stats wrapped up

Plus the essentials: search, details, trending, seasonal browsing, list management, social features, and community recommendations. All search and browse tools support pagination for browsing beyond the first page of results.

## Try it in 30 seconds

## Examples

Here are some things you can ask your AI assistant once ani-mcp is connected:

**"What should I watch next?"**
Uses `anilist_pick` to analyze your completed list, build a taste profile, and recommend titles from your Planning list ranked by how well they match your preferences.

**"I want something dark and psychological"**
Uses `anilist_pick` with mood filtering to boost titles matching that vibe and penalize mismatches.

**"What's good this season?"**
Uses `anilist_pick` with `source: SEASONAL` to rank currently airing anime against your taste profile.

**"I have 90 minutes, what should I watch tonight?"**
Uses `anilist_session` to pick from your currently watching list and fill a time budget with the best-matching episodes.

**"Any sequels airing for stuff I've finished?"**
Uses `anilist_sequels` to cross-reference your completed list with this season's lineup.

**"What order do I watch Fate in?"**
Uses `anilist_watch_order` to traverse the franchise relation graph and produce a numbered viewing order.

**"Compare my taste with username123"**
Uses `anilist_compare` to find shared titles, compute a compatibility score, and highlight biggest disagreements.

**"Why would I like Vinland Saga?"**
Uses `anilist_explain` to score a title against your taste profile, breaking down genre affinity and theme alignment.

**"Show me my anime year in review"**
Uses `anilist_wrapped` to summarize everything you watched in a given year.

## Mood config

`anilist_pick` and `anilist_session` accept a freeform `mood` string. Built-in keywords include: dark, chill, hype, action, romantic, funny, brainy, sad, scary, epic, wholesome, intense, mystery, fantasy, scifi, trippy, nostalgic, artistic, competitive, cozy.

To add or override keywords, set `ANILIST_MOOD_CONFIG` as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "ANILIST_MOOD_CONFIG": "{\"cozy\":{\"boost\":[\"Slice of Life\",\"Iyashikei\"],\"penalize\":[\"Horror\"]},\"mykeyword\":{\"boost\":[\"Romance\"],\"penalize\":[]}}"
}
```

Each key is a mood keyword mapping to `{ boost: string[], penalize: string[] }` arrays of AniList genres and tags.
